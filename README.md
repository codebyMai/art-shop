# Design & Planning:
Design and planning took into account Maria's 30 years of experience in the fine art world as well as my own research.
The website design is purposefully minimal to allow the visitors to fully focus on the artwork.
Fine art world tends to favour art over matter and look unfavourably upon the artists who are deemed to be focused solely on sales. 
Keeping this in mind I have designed a separate landing page serving as a portfolio and only after choosing to enter the shop tab 
will the user be led to the ecommerce part of the website. To maintain cohesion they are identical in styling yet posses different navbars.
As selling fine art is an artform in itself I have focused on avoiding the overly commercialized look to the store letting the artwork speak for itself. 
Artworks sold are unique originals and only a limited number of artworks will be available for purchase at any given time.
Maria Zawilska Art website serves double purpose:
- as a portfolio:
   * allowing Maria to keep presence in the world of contemporary fine art;
   * introducing new potential collectors to Maria's work;
   * as a point of contact for potential galleries and exhibition opportunities;
- as a store:
   * allowing Maria to sell her original works;
   * with potential expansion in the future into the limited fine art prints and commissions;
   * allowing customers to subscribe to the mailing list to receive updates on new works being available in the store;


### Business model
We are focusing on showcasing and selling original artworks directly to customers, bypassing traditional galleries or middlemen. The artist can generate revenue through the sale of individual paintings, offer limited edition prints for a lower price point, and potentially create custom commissions, while leveraging the website for marketing, brand building, and creating a direct connection with their audience. Offering secure online payment options and integrating shipping services streamlines the buying process.

As only original artworks are offered on the website at the moment, to emphasize the fine art nature of the product, just limited number of artworks is available for sale at any given time. This is intended to highlight the scarcity and exclusivity of the product. Subscribed customers will be informed of the upcoming restocks through the mailing campaign, creating anticipation.
  

### Marketing 
Currently the website caters to individual customers who wish to purchase original artworks of Maria Zawilska making it B2C focused.

Current marketing strategies:
- utilising social media by regularly posting engaging content and interacting with followers, Maria aims to build an online presence and increase the brand awareness:
![Facebook](readme_img/fb_mockup.png)
- customers are able to sign up to the mailing list to receive updates on new works being available in the store:
![MailChimp](readme_img/subscribe.png) 

Future marketing strategies:
- in the future Maria intends to utilize:
   * Instagram - even though it is extremely saturated and not very helpful in creating fine art sales it is helpful in creating brand awareness;
   * Pinterest - underestimated but very effective tool to sell fine art;
   * usage of the Google and Facebook ads;

### SEO
- I have used wordtracker.com to identify short tail and long tail keywords.
- The short-tail keywords include terms such as "art store, art for sale, fine art, original artwork, hand-painted, art for sale, miniature landscape," while the long-tail keywords are more specific and include phrases like "original oil paintings, Irish landscape paintings, fine art mini landscapes".
- After carefully analyzing and generating comprehensive list of targeted keywords I have placed these strategically throughout the website.

### Database 
![Colour Scheme](readme_img/database.png)

### Agile Methodology
I have created Kanban board to manage and visualize the workflow.
[Github project board](https://github.com/users/codebyMai/projects/5/views/1)

Project board was divided into 3 sections:
- To-Do- (all user stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
- In Progress- (then during the development phase and implementing functionality stories were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
- Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes and functionality is implemented to cover that user story)

### Logo
I have designed the logo in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) giving it a painterly effect to reflect the nature of the website.

### Colour scheme
Colour scheme is intentionally neutral and minimal to not to detract from the artwork.
![Colour Scheme](readme_img/colors.png)


# Features

### Navigation
There is two distinct sections of the website with their separate navigation menus:
<details><summary>Home</summary>
<img src="readme_img/nav1.png">

- superuser gets access to an additional tab displayed in the navigation menu: 'admin', which allows adding a product directly from the website without using the admin panel

# Bugs
## Remaining bugs
- Shopping bag validation throws errors in relation to stray and unclosed <form> and <td> elements which I investigated but failed to find a solution for within allocated time frame.
<details><summary>Bag</summary>
<img src="readme_img/bag_valid.png">
</details>
- Artworks are still visible after purchase and can be added to the bag by another customer - to amend this a future iteration will introduce a 'sold' label to sold artworks and quantity is going to be limited to one.
- MailChimp logo placement on smaller devices is not ideal.
- Despite many attempts I didn't manage to figure out what causes failure of payment.intent.succedded and confirmation emails. Out of the 4 events one continuously fails while three remaining succeed:
<details><summary>Stripe</summary>
<img src="readme_img/stripe.png">
</details>
- Attempts to fix error of hidden labels in the checkout, which HTML validation revealed, resulted in 2 unwanted visible input boxes appearing under the form. Time constraints prevented me from investigating the issue further.
